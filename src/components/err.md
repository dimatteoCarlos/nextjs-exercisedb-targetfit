Diagnosis: The build failure is due to a module not being found at line 80 in the file ./src/components/ShowListMenu.tsx.

Solution: To resolve the "Module not found" error for '.../app/_data/equipment/EquipmentExercisesData.json':

Ensure that the file 'EquipmentExercisesData.json' exists at the specified path relative to the file ShowListMenu.tsx.
Check for any typos or incorrect path references in the import statement inside ShowListMenu.tsx.
Verify the casing and correct spelling of the file and its path to avoid any issues
 with case sensitivity. If the file path is correct and the file exists, the build should succeed after
 resolving this import issue.
